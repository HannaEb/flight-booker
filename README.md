# Flight Booker

## About

Flight Booker is part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com) and focusses on building advanced forms. Users can book one-way flights by selecting dates and airports, choosing a flight from the resulting list, and finally entering passenger information.


## Progress

The search feature has been implemented. Users can not yet select flights or provide passenger information. 


## How to Use

```
$ git clone https://github.com/HannaEb/flight-booker.git
$ cd flight-booker
$ bundle
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
$ rails server
```
In your browser, enter http://localhost:3000/


## Testing

Not yet implemented.
